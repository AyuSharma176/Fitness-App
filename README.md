About The Project
The journey to fitness is often split into two challenging parts: the effort in the gym and the confusing question of what to eat afterwards. Befit was created to solve this exact problem. It's not just another fitness tracker; it's a smart companion that syncs your training with your nutrition.

This project was born out of a passion for fitness and a desire to use technology to solve a real-world problem for the health-conscious community in India and beyond.

🏋️‍♂️ Smart, Evolving Workouts: Receive the perfect workout plan for any day of the week, designed to help you build strength and break through plateaus.

🎯 Precise Calorie & Macro Tracking: Befit instantly calculates the exact fuel your body needs to recover and build muscle, ensuring you're never left guessing about your nutritional intake.
